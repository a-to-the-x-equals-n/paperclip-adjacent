    "Some people like complicated task management apps. This isn’t for them. __Paperclip Adjacent (PA)__ keeps things minimal: send a text message to add new _memory_ (memcells), and send a text to receive a list of all the current tasks stashed in your _second brain_. No extra steps; no unnecessary overhead. Users interact with PA via a few keyword commands. And when users have a moment to sit down, they can fine-tune their memcells through a graphical user interface that keeps everything organized and accessible. No bloat, no distractions—just a simple system that works. PA is \"external RAM\" to help remember middling tasks that keep escaping our periphery."
